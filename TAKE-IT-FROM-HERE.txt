Closed-loop MIP simulation-recomputation is working!
The only issue with it is to do with all the cases in which the experienced state makes for an MIP problem with an initial state which
makes a solution infeasible as per the formulation's constraints (e.g., where an initial state is making it fly outside a boundary or against an obstacle)!

It would be preferable to treat the obstacle-related cases separately from the boundary-related ones, since the former is an indication of the
fail cases of the approach, whereas the latter is more of an "arbitrary" artefact of the formulation.

Would be good to implement some function where we can tell these apart straightforwardly so we score the approaches more correctly.
