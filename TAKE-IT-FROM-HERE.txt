THINGS TO LOOK AT NEXT:

--> Obstacles now, as far as I've quickly gathered, working properly in the MIP model.
ONE THING TO NOTE is the fact that I AM NOT SURE whether the MIP model checks for whether the initial state is at an obstacle!
HAS TO DO WITH THE DETAILED SUM INDICES IN THE OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE CONSTRAINTS, CHECK IT!

--> UP NEXT:
need to figure out how to change obstacle matrix parameters from the python script in order to solve the MIP problem corresponding to the MDP model.

--> THEN
need to convert a history of velocities to a history of actions.
Remember, ultimate goal at this stage is to be able to run a closed-loop simulation using the MDP sampling methods, for which we need actions!, not velocities.
then we can compare things as we simulate them and re-solve the MIP when the outcomes differ, but always with the environment dynamics methods from before.
