THINGS TO LOOK AT NEXT:

--> was in the process of thinking how to implement closed-loop simulation given an mip solution. The challenge is that, whereas the MDP dynamics
sampling methods of before were expecting actions, the mip decision variables are just velocities. So, I need to take a history of velocities and
convert them into an equivalent history of actions, so that I can feed these to an environment sampling method and simulate the real thing
using methods from before.
As an important point, consider the nuances of doing this for the first time step in a history, TAKE CLUES FROM TAKE-IT-FROM-HERE.pdf


--> also need to extend obstacles feature into mip formulation. more slack variables needed (?)
