# University of Bristol, BEng Aerospace Engineering — RP3 by Gabriel Berk Pereira

This repository contains the code used to support the bulk of my RP3 work. 3 techniques were developed for trajectory optimisation of UAVs going on emergency landings onto prescribed landing sites — reinforcement learning by dynamic programming, reinforcement learning by Monte Carlo method, and mixed-integer linear programming.

3D state spaces correspond to rotary-wing agents, and 4D state spaces (addition of a velocity state variable) correspond to fixed-wing agents. Only the latter are addressed in the technical report, since it consists of a much more interesting problem in this context.
