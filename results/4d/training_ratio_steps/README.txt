This folder contains results regarding an investigation into what numbers of episodes and policy improvement steps to use in MONTE CARLO methods.

One of the underlying assumptions is that of using a number of episodes per improvement step that is proportional to the problem state space's
size, hence the mention of the ratio (no of episodes / size of state space).
On the other hand, the number of policy improvement steps follows no such sort of assumption, so it actually regards the proper integer number.
