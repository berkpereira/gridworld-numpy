this folder contains results concerning an investigation for what epsilon state space exploration parameter to use in MONTE CARLO
methods. A benchmark problem was used with complete fixed Monte Carlo parameters other than epsilon which was swept from 0 to 1.

The resulting policies were then evaluated as usual.
